# pca
The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It increases interpretability yet, at the same time, it minimizes information loss. It helps to find the most significant features in a dataset and makes the data easy for plotting in 2D and 3D. PCA helps in finding a sequence of linear combinations of variables.

The Principal Components are a straight line that captures most of the variance of the data. They have a direction and magnitude. Principal components are orthogonal projections (perpendicular) of data onto lower-dimensional space.


How does Principal Component Analysis Work?
1. Normalize the data
2. Build the covariance matrix
Construct a square matrix to express the correlation between two or more features in a multidimensional dataset.
3. Find the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
4. Sort the eigenvectors in highest to lowest order and select the number of principal components.
